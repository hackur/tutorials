#Introduction of Webduino

Webduino is the combination of Web and Arduino. It proclaims a new era of Web-controlled Arduino has come. There are some similar techniques and solutions in the market, however, they all need C/C++ to connect Arduino and internet, or to write C/C++ onto Arduino through internet. There is barely found a method simply applied Web technique to control Arduino.

<br/>

Webduino is different from traditional sensors which control Arduino with C or C++.  Webduino brings developers an easier way to connect Arduino by writing webpages (HTML / Javascript). It has lowered entry barriers into IoT so that developers' creativity can works freely without restriction. Developers can apply and connect various sensors to create remarkable applications of Internet of Things.

##What is Webduino Development Kit?

The Webduino Development Kit is an easy-to-use and easy-to-learn IoT development kit. Tackling Webduino, whether you are a beginner, an advanced developer, or a senior researcher can let you control the Arduino-compatible components. It's clearly indicated on the below diagram so that any front-end RD engineer can immediately configure the LED arrays via HTML and JavaScript.

##Webduino's Development Trend in the market of the "Internet of Things".

The future market for the IoT provides an amazing opportunity for the IT industry. Webduino was created based on the concept that many users are from diverse backgrounds and only a simple, cross-platform development module will satisfy them. Consequently, Webduino will become a must have tool for all HTML and JavaScript front-end developers.
