<h1>Introduction of Webduino</h1>
<p>Webduino is the combination of Web and Arduino. It proclaims a new era of Web-controlled Arduino has come. There are some similar techniques and solutions in the market, however, they all need C/C++ to connect Arduino and internet, or to write C/C++ onto Arduino through internet. There is barely found a method simply applied Web technique to control Arduino.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Webduino is different from traditional sensors which control Arduino with C or C++.  Webduino brings developers an easier way to connect Arduino by writing webpages (HTML / Javascript). It has lowered entry barriers into IoT so that developers&#39; creativity can works freely without restriction. Developers can apply and connect various sensors to create remarkable applications of Internet of Things.</p>

<h2>What is Webduino Development Kit?</h2>
<p>The Webduino Development Kit is an easy-to-use and easy-to-learn IoT development kit. Tackling Webduino, whether you are a beginner, an advanced developer, or a senior researcher can let you control the Arduino-compatible components. It&#39;s clearly indicated on the below diagram so that any front-end RD engineer can immediately configure the LED arrays via HTML and JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Webduino&#39;s Development Trend in the market of the &quot;Internet of Things&quot;.</h2>
<p>The future market for the IoT provides an amazing opportunity for the IT industry. Webduino was created based on the concept that many users are from diverse backgrounds and only a simple, cross-platform development module will satisfy them. Consequently, Webduino will become a must have tool for all HTML and JavaScript front-end developers.</p>
