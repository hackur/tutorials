<h1>Introduction to Webduino Smart</h1>
<p>Webduino Smart is a ground-breaking development board. Unlike Webduino Mark 1 and Webduino Fly, which need to combine with Arduino boards, Webduino Smart can function with the Internet and WebSocket independantly. It will be a path to lead an efficient and effective development of IoT.</p>
<h2>The Appearence</h2>
<p>Board dimensions: 3cm in length, 2.5cm in width, 1.3cm in height, and a weight of 85 grams. Digital pins: 0, 2, 4, 5, 14, and 16. 
PWM pins: 12, 13, 15. Analog Pin: AD (A0). 
Other pins: TX, RX, 3.3V, VCC, RST, and GRD.</p>

<h2>On-board Components and Pins</h2>
<p>Webduino Smart has a photocell sensor, an RGB LED, and a micro switch button onboard. The photocell is connected to the AD pin, and the RGB (Red, Geen, Blue) LED is connected to pins 15, 12, and 13 respectively <strong>(The LED is a common cathode, whereas most of the examples on this site use common anode RGB LED.)</strong> And the micro switch button is connected to pin 4. Please take note when you use these pins.</p>
